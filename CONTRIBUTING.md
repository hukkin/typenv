## Contributing
1. Fork/clone the repository.

1. Install dependencies (you'll probably want to create a virtual environment, using your preferred method, first).
    ```bash
    pip install poetry
    poetry install
    ```

1. Install pre-commit hooks
    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

1. After making changes and having written tests, make sure tests pass:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

1. Commit, push, and make a PR.

## Version bumping

`typenv` adheres to semantic versioning via the `bump2version` utility. Install it with pip:

```bash
pip install bump2version
```

Whenever you need to bump version, in the project root directory do:

```bash
bump2version (major | minor | patch)
git push <remote> <branch> --follow-tags 
```
